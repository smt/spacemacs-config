spacemacs-config
================

My .spacemacs and personal configuration layer(s).

.spacemacs
----------

The .spacemacs file must be present in the home directory to load. I tend to symlink this one to ~/.spacemacs and call it a day.

Config layers
-------------

Any folders in this repo are configuration layers. For the time being, I symlink them into the ~/.emacs.d/private directory, where Spacemacs will find them.
